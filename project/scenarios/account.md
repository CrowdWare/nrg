# Account

The account data is stored locally on the device. 
The account data stores public and private keys, the friends and the transactions.
If a transaction is getting useless (amount is worth noting anymore), it will not be stored anymore.

## Encryption
The user has to create a 5 digit pin which is used to login and to decrypt the account file.
So we don't need to store a passphrase in the app.
