# Trust

## Add trustful people
Before one can collect NRG he must at least add two persons that trust him an the app he's using.
Therefore A is showing a QR code with public key and additional data to be verified.
Then B scans the QR code, the data will be displayed to B, B has to press a button to accept that he trusts A, a QR code with the agreement (incl. public key of B) will be displayed and A scans it and adds B to trust list. 

## Start collecting NRG
After adding at least two people to trust list, A can collect NRG.

Now A can also exchange NRG with B. These transactions will encrypt the data using PK.
